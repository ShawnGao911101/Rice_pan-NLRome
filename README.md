# Rice pan-NLRome
This  GitHub repository archived the code and data generated from the following project:
> **Gao, Shang** ***et al.*** (forthcoming) Constructing rice pan-NLRome and identifying how it was reshaped to response changing pathogenic stress during domestication.

This repository is uploaded by Shang Gao at School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University.
 
## Visualization code
Codes for figure generation can be found in the following file: 
> `/Figure_Visualization_Code_15OCT2021.ipynb`

R and packages for data manipulation and figure generation are:
> R 3.6.3
> tidyverse
> ggplot2
> gapminder
> socviz
> ggsci
> gridExtra
> stringr
> scales
> ggrepel
> cowplot
> ggsignif
> UpSetR
> ggsankey
> ggmap
> sp
> maptools
> maps

## Data for visualization
The major information table for all NLR genes is:
>`/Data_for_visualization/summary_table_15Oct2021_1043.csv`

Most figures of this project are generated based on this table.
Other involved data in figure generation are also in `Data_for_visualization` directory.



## Result dataset
The following file includes all identified NLR (without filteration) from the 67 rice accessions:
>`/Result_dataset/rice_panNLRome_AA_Sequence_dataset.tar.gz`

The following file includes are the aligned consensus sequences of NB-ARC domains for all 863 HOGs:
>`/Result_dataset/all_HOG.cons.outgroup_added.mafft.fa`

The following file is the ML tree of the rice pan-NLRome generated by IQ-tree:
>`/Result_dataset/rice_panNLRome_phylogeny_IQ-tree.contree`
